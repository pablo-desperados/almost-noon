Almost noon is a very simple (and infact my first ) web app in which users can get local and cheap restaurant recommendations using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers) and the [IP-API.io](https://ip-api.io/) gem to extract the location of the user.

# Getting started

Clone the repo and run the following commands to get the app to run locally:
