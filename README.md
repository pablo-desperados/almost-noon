Almost noon is a very simple (and infact my first ) web app in which users can get local and cheap restaurant recommendations using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers) and the [IP-API.io](https://ip-api.io/) gem to extract the location of the user.

***
# Getting started

Clone the repo and run the following commands on your terminal to get the app to run locally:
```
bundle install
yarn install
```
Get the servers running by executing ```ruby server.rb``` and ```yarn start```

Finally go to ```http://localhost:4567```

***
# Usage

Just hit the **Tell me where to eat** button and you will be on your way to a great restaurant!
